# Vaader-ElProgram2
This is a Home Optimization Project for lowest energy costs. The USP is that we use the isolated house as a heat battery to minimize energycosts.

Please watch the video for more details! >> https://youtu.be/ln52k-g5RTQ?si=epgsfeSTMuHEkCsr

This repo is an user interface created for the database for easier maintenance and interaction with the database and the optimization program in the Vaader-ElOptimering repo. 

What we do in this repo:
- maintenance for limits of temperatures each day
- maintenance of default values and parameters
- simulate background optimization (Vaader-ElOptimering) for optimal parameter settings
